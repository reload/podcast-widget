## Publishing a new version

```
yarn build && yarn publish
```

The widget can be used through the jsdelivr CDN which is a mirror of the npm registry.

```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@reloaddk/podcast-widget@0.0.1-rc.8/
```

All that is needed is a div with the correct propreties attached.
For an example see `dev.html`.
